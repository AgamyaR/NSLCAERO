NSLC Aerospace Engineering Camp, June 2025

Memories from the NSLC NSLC Aerospace Engineering Camp in June 2025 hosted at the Johns Hopkins University. I learned some programming, some software and hardware systems and development, and much more beyond the computer. It was a wonderful experience, and I cannot wait to use the lessons and apply them to my day to day life.

All materials in the repository are not reccomended for use, and reccommended just for viewing some code on written on Arduino and memories.
